At Rocket Elevators, you are experts in building and selling elevators. However, we understand that backend web development is not your area of expertise. Since time management and efficiency
are key concerns for your business, we’ve selected the Node.js and Express framework to ensure your digital platform is built in the most efficient way possible.

This document will explain, in business-friendly terms, why Node.js with Express is the right choice for your project.

Node.js is a high-performance technology that allows us to run JavaScript (a language used for web development) on the backend (server-side)—not just inside a web browser. It is easier to think of
Node.js as a super-efficient engine that processes and delivers data for your website in real-time. It allows multiple users to access your system without slowdowns or delays.
Node.js handles and masters these elements:
Handles multiple users efficiently, which is great for a growing business.
It is faster than traditional server technologies.
Ideal for real-time applications like quotes, requests, and customer support; just to name a few.

On the other hand we have Express.js. Which is a framework that runs on top of Node.js, making it easier and faster to build web applications. Think of Express as a streamlined toolset that lets us
build secure, scalable, and flexible web applications without unnecessary complexity.

Its services reduce development time; which leads to faster setup, meaning your website gets built quicker.
Simplifies backend development; which allows it to be easier to maintain and improve over time.
Lastly its services are used by leading companies; meaning it is trusted by businesses worldwide.
